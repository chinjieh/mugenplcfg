Maybe have command switch to include bridges?
Refactor creator code to make it more extensible  (split into files??)
Make more code testable: Add arguments in functions
Double check info obtained
Test Protocols
Edit README.txt
Add Devicemanager
*Implement -everything arg that does not filter or modify anything

[High Priority]
Test serial device extraction
Test coverage*

[Medium Priority]
Running the tests creates an unclean git working copy
(test/schemadata/testschemaoutput.py)

Add Makefile to conveniently run the tests

[Low Priority]
Only update pci.ids if oldver < newvern

Maybe use pep8/autopep8 tools to make coding style comply with PEP 0008
(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)?
-> autopep8 -i srcfile fixes most problems automatically

Dependencies:
--------
Pyxb
Pci.ids (licensing)
iasl (DMAR parsing in IOMMUs)
